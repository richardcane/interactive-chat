# Interactive Chat

This plugin allows players to send and recieve messages with interactive keywords. As of now, these interactive keywords open the wiki page for the given keyword, or if the page doesn't exist, it'll open a wiki search. It does not currently work for split private messages.

## Sidenotes

Use `make run` to compile and run a shadow JAR that includes the plugin.
